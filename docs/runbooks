# Runbook for Incident Response

## Purpose
This runbook provides step-by-step instructions for responding to incidents within the SRE Lab environment. It aims to guide engineers through the process of identifying, mitigating, and resolving incidents effectively.

## Incident Response Steps

### 1. Identification
- Monitor alerts from the observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana).
- Check logs for anomalies or error messages.
- Confirm the incident by reproducing the issue if possible.

### 2. Triage
- Assess the severity of the incident:
  - **Critical**: Major impact on users or services.
  - **High**: Significant degradation of service.
  - **Medium**: Minor issues that do not affect users.
  - **Low**: Informational or cosmetic issues.
- Notify the incident response team via the designated communication channel.

### 3. Containment
- For critical incidents, implement immediate containment measures:
  - Scale down affected services.
  - Disable problematic features or endpoints.
  - Redirect traffic if necessary.

### 4. Investigation
- Gather relevant data:
  - Review metrics and logs.
  - Check recent changes in the infrastructure or application.
- Collaborate with team members to analyze the root cause.

### 5. Resolution
- Apply the fix:
  - Roll back recent changes if applicable.
  - Deploy a patch or update to resolve the issue.
- Validate the fix by monitoring the system for stability.

### 6. Recovery
- Restore services to normal operation.
- Communicate with stakeholders about the resolution and any impacts.

### 7. Post-Incident Review
- Conduct a postmortem to analyze the incident:
  - Document what happened, the response, and lessons learned.
  - Identify areas for improvement in processes or systems.
- Share findings with the team and update runbooks as necessary.

## Additional Resources
- Link to monitoring dashboards.
- Access to incident management tools.
- Contact information for team members involved in incident response.
